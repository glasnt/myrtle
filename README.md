# myrtle

A custom theme based on [clean-blog](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog-jekyll/), for use with glasnt.com sites. 

## Use

You are free to learn from this code, but you probably don't want to use it directly because your site will look like a glasnt.com site. I have hardcoded values in this theme that aren't overrideable in this current form, etc.
